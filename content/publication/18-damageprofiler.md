abstract = "In ancient DNA research, the authentication of ancient samples based on specific features remains a crucial step in data analysis. Because of this central importance, researchers lacking deeper programming knowledge should be able to run a basic damage authentication analysis. Such software should be user-friendly and easy to integrate into an analysis pipeline. Here, we present DamageProfiler, a Java based, stand-alone software to determine damage patterns in ancient DNA. The results are provided in various file formats and plots for further processing. DamageProfiler has an intuitive graphical as well as command line interface that allows the tool to be easily embedded into an analysis pipeline."
