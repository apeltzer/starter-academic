abstract = "The standardization, portability and reproducibility of analysis pipelines are key issues within the bioinformatics community. Most bioinformatics pipelines are designed for use on-premises; as a result, the associated software dependencies and execution logic are likely to be tightly coupled with proprietary computing environments. This can make it difficult or even impossible for others to reproduce the ensuing results, which is a fundamental requirement for the validation of scientific findings. Here, we introduce the nf-core framework as a means for the development of collaborative, peer-reviewed, best-practice analysis pipelines."
